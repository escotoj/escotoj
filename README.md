## Hello World! 👋 🌎 

🚀  Welcome to my page, a dedicated showcase of my extensive library of work and projects! Recently, I successfully completed UC Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp, where I gained invaluable hands-on experience with cutting-edge technologies such as JavaScript (Node, Express, React), CSS (Bootstrap, Jquery, Bulma, Handlebars, Material UI (MUI), React), and various databases like SQL, RESTful API, GraphQL, Sequelize, NoSQL, Mongoose, and MongoDB 🚀

🌱 Currently advancing my skills in the world of MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).

⚡ Fun fact: Computational thinking has spread outside of my code and into my life.

🔥 Latest project: 

- [Full-Stack MERN application deployed on Heroku.](https://github.com/escotoj/Card-X)
