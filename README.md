Hello there ðŸ‘‹ welcome to my github profile!
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and I've been having the most AMAZING time our teacher is incredibly smart and easy to follow and have been learning and picking up new technologies every week now working on back-end and our second project!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build full-stack applications with node handlebars logic and RESTful APIs using express and MySQL

âš¡ Fun fact: I come from an arts background mixed with a bit of technical recruitment. 

ðŸ”¥ Latest project: Full Stack Casino Application featuring Blackjack https://four-leaf-casino-app.herokuapp.com/login
